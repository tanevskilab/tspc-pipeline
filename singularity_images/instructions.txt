It is possible to build singularity images remotely using the servers
from sylabs.io. This avoids issues like not having sudo access in slurm
or more laborious tasks like building the image locally with docker and exporting
it later on as a singularity image (this is more complex when using a mac with ARM64).

The definition files can be found in their respective directory and the following commands
can be used to download them to use on the pipeline:

For cellpose-sam:
$ singularity pull --arch amd64 library://sebgoti/bioimage/cp-sam:4.0.7

For instanseg:
$ singularity pull --arch amd64 library://sebgoti/bioimage/instanseg:0.0.1
